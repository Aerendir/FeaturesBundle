ABOUT SUBSCRIPTION
==================

The `vat_rate` field
--------------------

This field saves the VAT rate to apply to the subscription when the user buys a feature or a plan.

This is a fixed value as the User ever is in his country and so this is ever the same value.

How to get the applicable vat rate depending on the country of the user is, for the moment, outside of the scope of the bundle.

So you, as developer, have to take care of guessing the applicable vat rate depending on your taxation rules. Once you have found the applicable vat rate, you can persist it here, to have it available in the future.
